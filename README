First you need to create all the build files used to compile the program with "cmake".

Then, you can compile the executables files with the command "make".

To run them, use the command "./neuron".

To run the google tests, use the commad "./runGtest".

You can also generate a doxygen documentation with the command "doxygen DoxyFile.in"

The tests 2.1 and test 2.2 are my main for the the step 2 of the project
before that I use the gtests. They use an old version of my code.
