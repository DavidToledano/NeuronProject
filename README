First you need to create all the build files used to compile the program with cmake.

Then, you can compile the executables files with the commad make.

To run them, use the command ./neuron.

To run the google tests, use the commad ./runGtest

The tests 2.1 and test 2.2 are my main for the the step 2 of the project
before that I use the gtests. They use an old version of my code.
